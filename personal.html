                <div class="personal-description">
                    <p>I really like a designer from my area, Rachel Parcell, and I looked at her website one day and I
                        saw the different ways I could make it better. I made it mobile responsive, because a lot of
                        shoppers are on phones. She has a very prominent Instagram presence, and really needs a mobile
                        friendly site, so her followers can go from her cute Instagram page to her cute mobile site.<br><br>

                        I gave it a simpler design as well. I saw that it wasn't quite as simple as it could have been,
                        and I decided to leave a couple of the things she has on her live site out of my clone, because
                        I felt that those things were not necessary.<br><br>

                        I love her designs, and I think the color scheme and the basic
                        layout is really cute. I kept the cute pink color, and I kept the peony idea, and I used all of
                        her designs and her descriptions and prices to keep the essence of her and the great designer
                        that she is.<br><br>

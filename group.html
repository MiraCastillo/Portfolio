                <div class="group-description">
                    <p>RoboRace is a real-time trivia-based game designed to allow friends to race against each other.  Points are not only distributed by correct answers, but also by how quickly a user can answer each question.<br><br>

                        RoboRace was effectively created as a group, where each member was assigned tasks to contribute to the application. Team meetings were scheduled daily to ensure continuity, productivity, and fluid integration when code merging occurred.<br><br>
                        
                        Socket.io was utilized to create our real-time engine, and by integrating a room key feature, users can connect and communicate amongst each other and the application in a private setting. With fairness in mind, Cron timers were also integrated into our Socket code to ensure that each user received the trivia questions at the exact same time.<br><br>
                        
                        We applied React as the front-end framework of RoboRace. Using JavaScript, React allowed us to create our functionality and then effortlessly write additional JSX code to display our components.<br><br>
                        
                        Node.js and Express were implemented on the back-end for handling all of the RESTful API requests and connecting to cloud-based PostgreSQL databases so that necessary user information could be stored.<br><br>
                        
                        Finally, through the use of Material UI, CSS, and media queries, RoboRace has a fun and colorful theme while still being intuitive and easy to navigate.<br><br><br>
